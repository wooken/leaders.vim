# Leaders

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wooken/leaders.vim.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wooken/leaders.vim)

List shortcuts mapped to `<Leader>`.
Optionally, if a comment precedes the mapping, the comment will be listed instead.

## OBSOLETE

Currently using `:map` function in vim. It's not as customizable but has the advantage of being easily scrollable. Keeping this project for reference.

## Requirements

- Vim with Python 3 support

## Installation

Use your favorite Vim plugin manager.

```
Plug 'wooken/leaders.vim'
```

## Usage

`:ListLeaders`
